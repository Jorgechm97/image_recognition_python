# Image Recognition Project in Python with Focus on Deep Learning and Neural Networks

This project focuses on image recognition using TensorFlow and the CIFAR-10 database, applying deep learning techniques and neural networks. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented to classify images into ten different categories, such as airplanes, cars, dogs, cats, among others. In addition, external images can be loaded to make predictions with the trained model.

## Features

- Loading and preprocessing of data from the CIFAR-10 database.
- Implementation of a CNN model for image recognition based on Deep Learning techniques.
- Model training with training and validation data.
- Evaluation of the model with test data to measure accuracy and loss.
- Saving the trained model for future use.
- Class prediction for uploaded external images.

## Used technology

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- warnings

## Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the main project file to load, train and evaluate the image recognition model.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the code comments to load external images and make predictions with the trained model.
4. To load the trained model, use the following line of code: `model = tf.keras.models.load_model("recognition.h5")`.
